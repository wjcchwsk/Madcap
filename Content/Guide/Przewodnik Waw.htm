        <h1>A 24 hr guide to Warsaw</h1>
        <p>Everyone’s always talking about how beautiful Krakow is, and sometimes <span class="bold">Warsaw </span>can feel left out. </p>
        <p>After all, Warsaw was totally destroyed and rebuilt after World War II, so it’s not as quaint as other cities in Poland.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>And one of the best ways to see Warsaw is to find the best views in the city! We’re going to head all over and discover them. My 24 hours in Warsaw began at the city’s most dominating feature, the Palace of Culture and Science. This massive Soviet-era tower was once the tallest building in Europe, all because Stalin wanted it to be. The iconic building once held theatres, universities, a Rolling Stones concert (the first behind the Iron Curtain by a western band) and rodent patrolling cats. Beyond that and since the day it was built, much of the building remains vacant.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Here's a list of other top sights in Warsaw:</p>
